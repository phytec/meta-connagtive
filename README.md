meta-connagtive
===============

This layer adds support for the [Connagtive IoT Device Suite](https://phytec.iot-suite.io/login)
on PHYTEC boards. In particular, PHYTEC's [Update & Device Management Kit](https://www.phytec.de/en/produkte/development-kits/update-und-devicemanagement-kit/)
demonstrates the functionalities of the Connagtive IoT Device Suite.

A full documentation about the Connagtive IoT Device Suite can be found here:

the IoT Device Suite you can contact the Connagtive support directly at
[support@iot-suite.io](mailto:support@iot-suite.io).
